6 credits  

Basic transient analysis of electric circuits. Formulation of circuit equations and possibilities of their solutions. 
Analysis of RC, RL, and RLC circuits ... (from \[1])


## Labs
During covid semester, we had usually "offline" labs online. So we just used [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to
"simulate" the offline labs. Nothing interesting to show, basic circuits - **17.5 of 18 points**.

## Project
Just one project, simple circuits related tasks like formulation of differential circuit equation that describes 
the circuit, expressing voltages/currents, ...  
See [project](project) for more info.
