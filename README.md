This repository contains code from computer labs.  
Usually, we had to implement key features (based on knowledge from lectures) to prepared the code structure.

1. [Reduction of color space](color_space_reduction)
2. [Generating simple objects in raster graphics](generating_simple_objects)
3. [Filling closed objects](objects_filling)
4. [3D transformation](3D_transformations)
5. [Rendering 2D curves in raster graphics](2d_curves)
6. Rendering 3D scene, OpenGL introduction
