## Tasks
- Implement function for reading and writing to the frame buffer (0.5 pts)
- Implement function for converting images to grayscale images (0.5 pts)
- Implement function for converting image to black&white image with matrix dithering (1 pts)
- Implement function for error distribution with Floyd-Steinberg method (1 pts)

## Application control
- `Left mouse button` - prints RGB value of the selected pixel to console
- `L` - loads image from `/data/image.bmp`
- `S` - saves the image to `/data/out.bmp`
- `G` - converts image to grayscale image
- `1-4` - converts image to black&white image using thresholds: 50, 100, 150, 200
- `R` - converts the image to black&white using the random dithering method
- `M` - converts the image to black&white using the matrix dithering method
- `D` - converts the image to black&white using the error distribution method
